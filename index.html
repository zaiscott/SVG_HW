            <h2>What is scale?</h2>
            
            <p>Based off the textbook, "Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range". Scale is a relationship between the data and visual being created, helping to compute mathmatical problems like: scaleLinear, scaleSqrt, and scalePow.</p>
            
            <h2>Why is it useful?</h2>
            
            <p>Scale can be used to help create visualizations of large data sets to help show them without killing ones' eye.

                Also, you can create different funtoions to cpnvert tjhe data into different or new arrays thus showing that all data sets can be changef into any useful or needed outputs.
